  It is well known that Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most influential and
  important artists in history, did not receive the recognition his art deserved
  during his lifetime. His figure coexists with the black legend of the
  unsuccessful artist who never sold a painting during his lifetime, something
  to which the most knowledgeable in the subject usually reply that he did sell
  at least one painting in his entire career. But, is that true?

It is well known that Vincent Van Gogh, one of the most influential and important artists in history, did not receive the recognition his art deserved during his lifetime. His figure coexists with the black legend of the unsuccessful artist who never sold a painting during his lifetime, something to which the most knowledgeable in the subject usually reply that he did sell at least one painting in his entire career. But, is that true?

Although there is no exact number of paintings sold by Van Gogh, we know that he sold more than one work during his lifetime. In 1890, Van Gogh sold one of his most famous paintings, "The Red Vineyard near Arles," to a Belgian painter named Anna Boch. This painting has become a symbol of Van Gogh's dedication and passion for art, and although it was only sold for 400 francs, today its value has multiplied enormously for obvious reasons.![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_036.jpg/1200px-Vincent_Willem_van_Gogh_036.jpg)*"The Red Vineyard near Arles", Van Gogh.*&#x20;

Although this is the only sale known for certain, it is suspected that more of Van Gogh's works were sold during his lifetime. For example, his uncle Cor, an art dealer, commissioned 19 works about The Hague, and although it is not known if any of these were sold, it is an indication that Van Gogh probably sold more works in his lifetime. In addition, some records indicate that the painter also sold one painting to a French dealer named Julien Tanguy, and another to a gallery in London thanks to his brother Theo.

It should be noted that many of the sales Van Gogh made were to art dealers, which may have contributed to the perception that he only sold one painting in his lifetime. However, it is important to note that Van Gogh also sold drawings during his career, not just paintings, including two drawings sold to a religious pastor in 1879 and twelve drawings sold by pen in 1882.

In addition to these known sales, Van Gogh also made several exchanges with other artists, such as Paul Gauguin, with whom he was living and working in Arles in the year 1888. In that period, Van Gogh made several gifts of paintings and drawings to Gauguin, and also exchanged some of his paintings with other artists.![](https://static.abc.es/media/cultura/2020/06/09/vagogh-gauguin-kWCE--1200x630@abc.jpg)*Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin*

It is important to note that although Van Gogh did not gain success and recognition during his lifetime, this does not mean that his works were not valued. In fact, his brothers Theo and Cor, as well as other friends and colleagues, appreciated his art and encouraged him to continue creating.&#x20;

Van Gogh sometimes received positive reviews from the art press, and several of his paintings were exhibited in art galleries and art fairs during his lifetime. However, the art market at the time was very different from today, and it is true that, in general, Van Gogh's works did not find buyers interested in acquiring them. Many of his paintings were considered too experimental and unconventional, and his style was seen as strange and out of the ordinary.

It is also important to mention that Van Gogh did not have an easy life, and the lack of money and support affected his mental health and his ability to continue creating. However, despite all this, he continued to work until his death, and left a unique and valuable artistic legacy.

In the twentieth century, interest in his work and style increased significantly, and his paintings have been exhibited in museums and galleries around the world. Today, Van Gogh is recognized as one of the most important and revolutionary artists in the history of art, and his paintings are considered true gems worth millions of dollars.In conclusion, although Van Gogh did not have much success and recognition during his lifetime, this does not mean that he did not sell more than one painting.&#x20;

In fact, he sold several works throughout his life, and today his artistic legacy is recognized and valued all over the world. However, it is important to note that a lack of recognition and success during his lifetime is not always indicative of the worth of a work of art, and that success can take time to come.
