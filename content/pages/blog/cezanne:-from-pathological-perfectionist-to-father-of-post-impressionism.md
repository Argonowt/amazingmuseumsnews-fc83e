Cézanne was born in 1839 in Aix-en-Provence, and moved to Paris in 1861 to study art. There he met Camille Pissarro, with whom he developed a close friendship and artistic collaboration. Together they explored the possibilities of color, light and form, and created works that broke with academic conventions and anticipated the birth of Cubism.

Paul Cézanne was a perfectionist when it came to his art. The French Impressionist painter was so stressed by his work that he was often known to tear canvases and destroy them. When painting outdoors, some of these paintings would end up being thrown into the bushes by the frustrated artist. He was once seen trying to retrieve a painting from a large tree after he had calmed down.

The Musée d'Orsay, which, along with the Louvre, is one of the most famous and visited museums in Paris, houses an impressive collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works. Among them, the paintings of Paul Cézanne, one of the most influential and innovative artists of his time, stand out.

At the Musée d'Orsay you can admire some of Cézanne's best works, covering different genres and stages of his career. Among them are The Card Players (between 1890 and 1895): a series of five paintings depicting everyday scenes of peasants playing cards in a tavern. Cézanne simplified shapes and colors, and created a balanced and harmonious composition.
