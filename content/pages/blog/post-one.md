### Prado Museum (Madrid)

The Prado Museum is perhaps the most important museum in Spain, with a collection of works from the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries and all that means: Velázquez, Goya, El Greco and Murillo are all here. But not only Spanish painters, the Prado also has works by Rubens, Tintoretto and Titian. A must for lovers of classical art, and about which, from GrandesMuseos.news, we will publish a guide this September 2022.

### Picasso Museum (Malaga)

Picasso comes from Malaga, so in the city there are not one but two museums dedicated to the artist. The Picasso Museum, with 285 works, is the perfect place to delve into his career and all the areas of art he touched. In addition, the museum often hosts temporary exhibitions of Picasso and other artists.

### Joan Miró Foundation (Barcelona)

The collection of the Joan Miró Foundation is located in Montjuic and includes some of the most famous and well-known works of the Catalan painter. In total, more than 10,000 works (paintings, sculptures, textiles and drawings) serve as a guide to discover and understand the artist's profession, from his early drawings to his youth and the great portraits he eventually painted. The idea for this museum came from Miró himself, to ensure that his work is always available to the public.

### Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao)

The Guggenheim in Bilbao, which has been open since 2007, is a work of art starting with its building, designed by Frank Gehry Architects. As for the exhibits at the museum, they tend to change frequently and focus on 20th and 21st century works. If you are one of those people who don't understand the term "art installation" or have never been there (or just to see the building from the outside), or if you love contemporary art, the Guggenheim Bilbao is a must-see.

### Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum (Madrid)

The Prado, Reina Sofia and Thyssen-Bornemisza museums are known as Madrid's "art triangle. And what's in that third corner? A little bit of everything for all tastes. Their collections range from Italian and German Renaissance, through Flemish painting (Rubens, Spain's only Van Eyck or Rembrandt), Impressionism (Manet, Monet, etc.), Expressionism (Van Gogh, Munch, etc.) and several examples of 20th century avant-garde fine art.

### Reina Sofia National Museum and Art Center (Madrid)

And we continue with the next edge of the "Art Triangle". For those of you who enjoy the art of the last two centuries, the Reina Sofia is your place. In a former hospital building, this museum houses paintings by artists such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró or Salvador Dalí, with a large collection of works by each of them, as well as many examples of names from great artistic movements such as surrealism and cubism. This is the place to go to see Guernica (Picasso) or The Girl in the Window (Dalí).

*Dalí Theater-Museum, Figueres.*

### Dalí Theater-Museum (Figueres)
Which brings us to the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Figueres. If you like Salvador Dalí, you must travel to his birthplace, Figueres, and visit this museum whose project was created by the artist himself. The enclosure includes his last room and his tomb, which are located inside the museum itself. As its name suggests, the building housing this large collection of Salvador Dalí's works was formerly a theater, where the painter exhibited for the first time in 1918. Along with the Reina Sofía, the Dalí Theater-Museum in Figueres is one of the places with the largest collection of the artist's works.

### National Museum of Roman Art (Mérida)

Inaugurated in 1986, the construction of this Museum and Research Center of Roman Art was one of the first great works of the architect Rafael Moneo and also the work that led him to begin to gain recognition outside Spain. The museum itself is for any lover of Roman culture: more than 36,000 exhibits, archaeological remains from the city of Emerita Augusta, as well as lectures, courses, temporary exhibitions and other activities.

### Valencian Institute of Modern Art (Valencia)

The Valencian Institute of Modern Art (IVAM) specializes in the avant-garde art of the 20th century, making a fairly complete tour of movements such as abstraction or pop-art. In addition to permanent exhibitions, it often offers temporary exhibitions. Among the paintings we can visit are works by international artists such as Paul Klee, Robert Delaunay and Frantisek Kupka.
