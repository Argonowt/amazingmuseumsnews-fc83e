Did you know that the Mona Lisa has her own mailbox in the Louvre for all the love letters she receives? That's right, Leonardo da Vinci's famous painting has captivated many admirers over the centuries, who have left her offerings of flowers, poems and, yes, love notes. Some have even gone to unusual extremes, such as the artist Luc Maspero, who allegedly committed suicide in 1852 by jumping from a hotel balcony because "For years I have struggled desperately with his smile. I would rather die." Who knew that artistic appreciation could be so obscure?

In this article we will tell you more about the fascination that the Mona Lisa has generated, the reasons why she has become a cultural icon and some of the secrets hidden in her enigmatic expression. We'll also show you some of the most curious love letters the lady of the Louvre has received and how you can send her yours if you're so inclined. Don't miss it!

The mailbox is located in a room next to the one housing the portrait, and is decorated with a reproduction of the enigmatic woman's face. There, visitors can deposit their letters, which are collected by the museum staff and stored in a special archive.

What do these letters say? According to some testimonies, there is everything from intimate confessions to questions about the identity or meaning of the work. Some write him poems, others ask for advice or tell him about their problems. There are those who thank him for inspiring them or for accompanying them in difficult moments. And there are also those who propose marriage or declare their passion.

It is not known exactly when this tradition began, but it is believed to date back to the 19th century, when the Mona Lisa became a worldwide icon thanks to the reproductions and copies that were made of her. Since then, its popularity has continued to grow, and it has become one of the most viewed and photographed works of art in history.

But the Mona Lisa also hides many secrets and mysteries, which have fueled the imagination and curiosity of admirers. For example, who was the woman who posed for Leonardo? What did she want to express with her smile? What hidden symbols are in the painting? Is it a self-portrait of the painter?

Estas y otras preguntas han sido objeto de numerosas investigaciones y teorías, algunas más verosímiles que otras. Lo cierto es que Leonardo da Vinci nunca terminó del todo la obra, y que siguió trabajando en ella hasta su muerte en 1519. Se cree que la pintó entre 1503 y 1506, y que representa a Lisa Gherardini, la esposa de un rico comerciante de seda florentino llamado Francesco del Giocondo. De ahí que también se le conozca como La Gioconda.

La técnica que empleó Leonardo para pintarla fue muy innovadora para la época, y consistía en aplicar capas muy finas y transparentes de óleo sobre álamo, creando un efecto de profundidad y luminosidad. También usó el sfumato, un método para difuminar los contornos y crear una atmósfera nebulosa. Estos recursos le permitieron crear una obra maestra de la perspectiva y el realismo, que sigue fascinando a millones de personas.
