Pity is a feeling of compassion and empathy that has been depicted throughout history in various artistic forms. One of the most famous depictions of piety is the famous Italian Renaissance sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti, known simply as Michelangelo. Among all his masterpieces, one in particular stands out: the Pietà, the only work the artist signed.

Michelangelo is widely recognized as one of the most influential and talented artists in history. His unique style and exceptional sculpting skills led him to create some of the most celebrated works of all time, such as the sculpture of David and the frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. However, unlike many contemporary artists, Michelangelo rarely signed his works, so why did he choose to do so with the Pietà?

## Why did Michelangelo sign the Pietà?

First, it is important to understand the role of the author as a figure in the art world. For much of art history, artists were considered mere artisans. Their work was intended to beautify churches, palaces and public squares, and they were not attributed the same importance that they are given today. In many cases, artists were hired on commission and their work was done anonymously.

However, as the Renaissance flourished, the notion of "authorship" began to gain importance. Artists, led by figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, began to be recognized as creative individuals with a unique vision. This led to a greater appreciation of their work and, eventually, they began to sign their works.

Michelangelo, despite his undeniable genius, signed only one of his works: the Pietà. This sculpture, completed in 1499, depicts the Virgin Mary holding the body of Christ after the crucifixion. It is a masterpiece that shows delicacy and sadness in the figures, capturing the essence of piety.

*Michelangelo's Pietà, the artist's only signed work.

So why did he choose to sign this particular work? It is believed that Michelangelo signed it because of the artist's youth at the time. He was only 24 years old when he completed the Pietà, and he wanted to make sure that his name was associated with this masterpiece. In addition, the Pietà was commissioned by French Cardinal Jean de Billheres for his funeral chapel in St. Peter's Basilica, which may have influenced Michelangelo's decision to sign it.

The Pietà is an emblematic work that shows Michelangelo's technical and artistic mastery. Over the years, it has been established that most of the works attributed to the artist are his, even if they are not signed. The unmistakable quality and style of his work has allowed experts to identify and authenticate his creations.
