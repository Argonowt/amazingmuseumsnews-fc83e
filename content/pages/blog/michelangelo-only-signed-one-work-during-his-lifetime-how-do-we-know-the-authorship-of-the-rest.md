  Pity is a feeling of compassion and empathy that has been depicted throughout
  history in various artistic forms. One of the most famous depictions of piety
  is the famous Italian Renaissance sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti, known
  simply as Michelangelo. Among all his masterpieces, one in particular stands
  out: the Pietà, the only work the artist signed. Michelangelo is widely
  recognized as one of the most influential and talented artists in history. His
  unique style and exceptional sculpting skills led him to create some of the
  most celebrated works of all time, such as the sculpture of David and the
  frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. However, unlike many contemporary artists,
  Michelangelo rarely signed his works, so why did he choose to sign the Pietà?
  Why did Michelangelo sign the Pietà? First, it is important to understand the
  role of the author as a figure in the art world. For much of art history,
  artists were considered mere artisans. Their work was intended to beautify
  churches, palaces and public squares, and they were not attributed the same
  importance that they are given today. In many cases, artists were hired on
  commission and their work was done anonymously. However, as the Renaissance
  flourished, the notion of "authorship" began to gain importance. Artists, led
  by figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, began to be recognized
  as creative individuals with a unique vision. This led to a greater
  appreciation of their work and, eventually, they began to sign their works.
  Michelangelo, despite his undeniable genius, signed only one of his works: the
  Pietà. This sculpture, completed in 1499, depicts the Virgin Mary holding the
  body of Christ after the crucifixion. It is a masterpiece that shows delicacy
  and sadness in the figures, capturing the essence of piety.

  *Michelangelo's Pietà, the artist's only signed work* So why did he choose to
  sign this particular work? It is believed that Michelangelo signed it because
  of the artist's youth at the time. He was only 24 years old when he completed
  the Pietà, and he wanted to make sure that his name was associated with this
  masterpiece. In addition, the Pietà was commissioned by French Cardinal Jean
  de Billheres for his funeral chapel in St. Peter's Basilica, which may have
  influenced Michelangelo's decision to sign it. The Pietà is an emblematic work
  that shows Michelangelo's technical and artistic mastery. Over the years, it
  has been established that most of the works attributed to the artist are his,
  even if they are not signed. The unmistakable quality and style of his work
  has allowed experts to identify and authenticate his creations. ## Artists who
