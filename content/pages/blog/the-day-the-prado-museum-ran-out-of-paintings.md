  The story of the transfer of the Prado Museum's masterpieces during the
  Spanish Civil War is one of the most fascinating and dramatic in Spanish
  culture. In the midst of the conflict, the country's artistic heritage was
  threatened by the bombing of the Condor Legion, which sought to destroy the
  symbol of Spanish identity. Faced with this danger, an unprecedented operation
  was organized to save the paintings of Goya, Velázquez and other great
  masters.Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

These works, which were part of the cultural heritage of the Republic, were transferred from Madrid to Valencia, where the Prado Museum Delegation was created. From there, they continued their route to Barcelona, where the Museo Nacional de Arte de Cataluña was installed. When the Republican defeat became imminent, it was decided to evacuate the works to France, where they were given political asylum.

The trip was risky, as they had to cross the border under enemy fire. A total of 71 truckloads of masterpieces made it to France and, from there, were transported to Geneva, where they stayed at the Palais des Nations. They remained there until the end of the world war and it was possible to negotiate their return to Spain, where, fortunately, they were all returned.

The transfer of the works from the Prado was a heroic feat that involved numerous people and institutions, both national and international. It was also an act of resistance and defense of culture against barbarism. Thanks to him, some of the jewels of universal art were preserved for posterity, which we can admire today in the most important museum in Spain.

The director of the Prado during those years, Pablo Picasso, was the main responsible for the operation. In his pocket he kept a note with the conditions he demanded in exchange for the return of what was usurped: the end of the war, the reestablishment of the Republic and respect for the autonomy of Catalonia.

If you are interested in learning more about the museum and its history, we recommend El Prado Guía de Arte, an essential art guide to discover and learn the essentials of the greatest works, artists and styles in the Prado Museum, among which are some of the greatest artists of universal painting.
