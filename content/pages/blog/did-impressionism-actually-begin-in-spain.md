Although many consider that impressionism was a radical break with tradition, the truth is that there were antecedents and precursors that paved the way for this movement. In this article, we are going to analyze two masterpieces housed in the Prado Museum that are considered to be the first impressionist paintings in history.

## What is Impressionism?

Impressionism was an artistic movement that emerged in France in the late 19th century and was characterized by the attempt to capture the optical impression of light and color on objects, without concern for their identity or detail. Impressionist painters rejected academic principles, grand historical, mythological and religious subjects, and the study of drawing. Instead, they devoted themselves to painting outdoors, everyday scenes of urban and rural life, and natural landscapes, using loose, rapid and spontaneous brushstrokes, which formed patches of color that were best perceived from a distance.

Among the main representatives of impressionism were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas, Berthe Morisot, Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro and Paul Cézanne. Some of them were influenced by English landscape painters such as Joseph Mallord William Turner and John Constable, who had already explored the effects of light and color on the landscape. They were also inspired by the French painter Édouard Manet, who broke with academic conventions and shocked the public with his works such as Lunch on the Grass or Olympia.

Among the most outstanding technical characteristics of Impressionism, the following can be mentioned:

* Use of pure and complementary colors: Impressionists did not mix colors on the palette, but applied them directly on the canvas in small brushstrokes. In this way they managed to create an effect of vibration and luminosity. In addition, they used complementary colors (the opposites in the chromatic circle) to create contrasts and shadows. For example, they used green to shade red, or violet to shade yellow.

* Absence of chiaroscuro: Impressionists did not use chiaroscuro (the contrast between light and shadow) to create volume or depth. Instead, they used changes in color and tone to suggest the shape and distance of objects. Thus they avoided blacks and browns, which they considered dirty and dull colors.

* Outdoor painting: The Impressionists preferred to paint outdoors, in direct contact with nature and natural light. To this end, they made use of the invention of oil paint tubes, which allowed them to easily transport their materials. In this way, they were able to capture the variations of light and color according to the time of day and the seasons of the year.

* Representation of the instant: The Impressionists sought to capture the visual impression of the moment, without worrying about the fidelity or permanence of what was represented. For this reason, their works have a fleeting and unfinished appearance, reflecting the speed with which they worked. This is also why they chose everyday and ephemeral subjects, such as a sunset, a reflection in the water, a street scene or a popular dance.

* Atmospheric perspective: The Impressionists used atmospheric perspective to create a sense of depth and remoteness. This technique consists of blurring the contours and reducing the contrast and saturation of colors as they move away from the foreground. This mimics the effect of the atmosphere on vision.

These are some of the technical characteristics of impressionism, a movement that revolutionized the history of art and paved the way for the avant-garde movements of the 20th century, but which other earlier works shared and explored.
