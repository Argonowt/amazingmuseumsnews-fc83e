In this article we are going to talk about one of the most important painters of the Italian Renaissance: Jacopo Robusti, better known as Tintoretto. His work is characterized by the use of light, color and movement, as well as by his influence on later artists such as Rubens or Vel√°zquez. However, his life was marked by curious events, so join us to discover the life and work of this painting genius.

## 1 His nickname is due to his father.

Tintoretto's father was a dyer, that is, an artisan who dyed fabrics. Therefore, his son was given the nickname Tintoretto, which means "little dyer" in Italian.

## 2 He was a disciple of Titian.

Tintoretto deeply admired Titian, the master of the Venetian school. According to legend, he sneaked into his workshop to copy his works and learn his techniques. However, Titian did not appreciate his talent and expelled him from his studio.

## 3 He was a tireless worker.

Tintoretto had a great passion for painting and devoted all his time to perfecting his art. It is said that he slept only four hours a day and had a motto in his studio: "The drawing of Michelangelo and the color of Titian."
